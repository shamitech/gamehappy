            <h2 id="overview">Game Overview</h2>
            <p>Secret Syndicates is a thrilling social deduction game where players are secretly assigned roles as either members of a hidden criminal syndicate or innocent townspeople. The objective is simple in concept but complex in execution: the Town must identify and eliminate all Syndicate members before they eliminate the Town, while the Syndicate works in secret to eliminate innocent citizens.</p>

            <p>The game combines elements of psychology, deduction, communication, and bluffing to create an engaging experience that lasts 10-20 minutes per round. Each round presents new challenges and forces players to make critical decisions under pressure.</p>

            <h2 id="roles">Understanding the Roles</h2>
            <p>Each player receives a secret role that determines their team, abilities, and win condition. Understanding these roles is fundamental to successful play.</p>

            <h3>Town Roles</h3>

            <div class="role-card">
                <h3>👤 Bystander</h3>
                <p><strong>Team:</strong> Town | <strong>Quantity:</strong> Majority of players</p>
                <p>The Bystander has no special abilities - they must rely on observation, deduction, and discussion to identify Syndicate members. However, their greatest strength is their numbers and the ability to vote during the day phase.</p>
                <p><strong>Win Condition:</strong> Eliminate all Syndicate members through voting.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="role-card">
                <h3>🔎 Detective</h3>
                <p><strong>Team:</strong> Town | <strong>Quantity:</strong> 1 player (in larger games)</p>
                <p>The Detective can investigate one player each night phase and learn their exact role. This information is crucial for identifying Syndicate members. However, the Detective must be careful - if Syndicate members discover who the Detective is, they become a priority target for assassination.</p>
                <p><strong>Abilities:</strong> Investigate another player each night to learn their role | <strong>Win Condition:</strong> Eliminate all Syndicate members</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Syndicate Roles</h3>

            <div class="role-card">
                <h3>🔴 Syndicate Member</h3>
                <p><strong>Team:</strong> Syndicate | <strong>Quantity:</strong> Minority of players</p>
                <p>Syndicate members work together in secret. During each night phase, they vote on which townsperson to assassinate. One Syndicate member carries out the assassination while others create alibis and spread disinformation during the day. Syndicate members know each other's identities, giving them a significant advantage.</p>
                <p><strong>Abilities:</strong> Vote during night to eliminate a townsperson; know other Syndicate members | <strong>Win Condition:</strong> Eliminate enough Town members so Syndicate equals or outnumbers Town</p>
            </div>

            <h2 id="phases">Game Phases Explained</h2>

            <h3>Phase 1: Night Phase</h3>
            <p>The night phase is when the Syndicate acts. During the night:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All players receive a "Night" notification</li>
                <li>Syndicate members secretly vote on who to assassinate</li>
                <li>If a Detective is alive, they can investigate one player</li>
                <li>The investigation and assassination occur simultaneously</li>
                <li>Town members and unaware players see just "Night Phase" with no information</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Phase 2: Murder Discovery</h3>
            <p>The results of the night phase are revealed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All players learn who was assassinated</li>
                <li>A story is presented explaining the murder</li>
                <li>The Detective learns who they investigated and their role</li>
                <li>Players begin forming theories about who the Syndicate members are</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Phase 3: Trial Phase</h3>
            <p>This is the discussion and debate phase:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Players discuss who they think is guilty</li>
                <li>Arguments are made and theories shared</li>
                <li>This is where psychology and persuasion matter most</li>
                <li>Players build alliances and test loyalty</li>
                <li>The goal is to build consensus around a suspect</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Phase 4: Accusation & Vote</h3>
            <p>Players formally accuse and vote:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A player is formally accused</li>
                <li>All players vote: Guilty or Not Guilty</li>
                <li>Majority vote determines if the accused player is eliminated</li>
                <li>If eliminated, the player's role is revealed to everyone</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Phase 5: Verdict & Repeat</h3>
            <p>The cycle continues:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If Town eliminated a Syndicate member, they gain information</li>
                <li>If they eliminated an innocent, Syndicate grows stronger</li>
                <li>The cycle repeats: Night → Murder → Trial → Accusation → Verdict</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <strong>💡 Key Insight:</strong> Each wrong elimination by the Town is a victory for the Syndicate. Syndicates benefit from chaos and misdirection.
            </div>

            <h2 id="town-strategy">Winning Strategies for Town Players</h2>

            <h3>Rule #1: Pay Attention to Voting Patterns</h3>
            <p>How people vote reveals more than what they say. Syndicate members often:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Vote with each other to protect allies</li>
                <li>Vote against innocent players to frame them</li>
                <li>Avoid drawing attention to close Syndicate members</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Track voting patterns across multiple rounds. Do the same people always vote together? Do they consistently target one player while protecting another? These patterns are golden clues.</p>

            <h3>Rule #2: Question Confident Claims</h3>
            <p>Innocent players often admit uncertainty. Syndicates build confident, detailed stories. When someone makes a strong claim about who they suspect:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ask them why they're so confident</li>
                <li>Search for logical gaps in their reasoning</li>
                <li>See if they can defend their position under pressure</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="strategy-box">
                <strong>Strategy:</strong> Avoid making definitive claims early. Instead, ask questions and see how others respond. Let them commit to positions, then challenge them.
            </div>

            <h3>Rule #3: Identify the Detective Early</h3>
            <p>The Detective is the Town's most powerful asset. Syndicates will target the Detective's family or close allies to prevent effective play. If you're the Detective:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Don't share your role immediately</li>
                <li>Build multiple alliances so you don't stand out</li>
                <li>Share information slowly and strategically</li>
                <li>Plant false investigations to mislead the Syndicate</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Rule #4: Look for Statistical Anomalies</h3>
            <p>In a balanced game, Syndicates are outnumbered. By process of elimination:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If 3 players consistently vote together, at least one is likely innocent (since voting together all the time draws suspicion)</li>
                <li>If 2 players never vote together, they might be protecting each other</li>
                <li>If someone changes their voting pattern dramatically, something has changed</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Rule #5: Create Pressure and Watch Reactions</h3>
            <p>Innocent players react emotionally when falsely accused. Syndicates respond more logically:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Directly accuse someone and watch their reaction</li>
                <li>Does their response seem genuine or practiced?</li>
                <li>Do they counter-accuse immediately (deflection) or defend (genuine)?</li>
                <li>Genuine confusion is usually different from clever lying</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="syndicate-strategy">Winning Strategies for Syndicate Players</h2>

            <h3>Rule #1: Establish Your Cover Story</h3>
            <p>Your story must be simple, consistent, and defensible:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Start early:</strong> Make your first accusations early to establish your "investigative" persona</li>
                <li><strong>Pick a lane:</strong> Be the person who always suspects a certain type of player (e.g., "quiet players are sus")</li>
                <li><strong>Protect allies subtly:</strong> Vote against others while avoiding voting together constantly</li>
                <li><strong>Show "growth":</strong> Change your theory as new information emerges - this looks natural</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="strategy-box">
                <strong>Strategy:</strong> The best cover is to act like you're genuinely trying to find the Syndicate. This makes you invisible because you're doing exactly what the Town is doing.
            </div>

            <h3>Rule #2: Control the Narrative</h3>
            <p>Whoever speaks first often shapes how people think:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>After each murder, immediately offer a theory</li>
                <li>Frame innocent players by connecting dots (even false ones)</li>
                <li>Use logical language ("This doesn't add up, which suggests...")</li>
                <li>Let others dispute your theory - their defensiveness looks suspicious</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Rule #3: Protect Your Allies Strategically</h3>
            <p>Don't protect Syndicate members too obviously:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Vote to eliminate an innocent player most other Syndicates want eliminated, then act reluctant</li>
                <li>Suggest eliminating a different innocent player that you actually want gone</li>
                <li>Vote with the Town majority to look innocent, then quietly protect Syndicates</li>
                <li>If a Syndicate member is under fire, redirect suspicion to someone else</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Rule #4: Create Confusion</h3>
            <p>The more confused the Town is, the better. Syndicates thrive in chaos:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Introduce multiple theories so people don't know which to believe</li>
                <li>Question each other (Syndicate members) to show you're independent thinkers</li>
                <li>Point out gaps in other people's logic</li>
                <li>Make the detective doubt their own investigation</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Rule #5: Know When to Pivot</h3>
            <p>If a strategy isn't working, adapt:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If your cover story is challenged, have a backup theory ready</li>
                <li>If someone is close to discovering you, deflect early</li>
                <li>If the Detective is investigating you, act defensive (not hiding, just defensive)</li>
                <li>If other Syndicates are identified, distance yourself strategically</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="advanced">Advanced Tactical Concepts</h2>

            <h3>Confirmation Bias Exploitation</h3>
            <p>Once people believe something, they interpret all evidence through that lens. Syndicates can use this:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Establish that "Player A is suspicious" early</li>
                <li>Collect circumstantial evidence and interpret it to confirm suspicion</li>
                <li>When Player A reacts emotionally (from being under pressure), use that as evidence</li>
                <li>The Town will mob-vote based on the established suspicion</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Power of First Accusation</h3>
            <p>The first person to accuse someone gains credibility:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you accuse the right person, you look brilliant</li>
                <li>If you accuse the wrong person, claim you were "investigating a lead"</li>
                <li>Either way, your early accusation shapes the narrative</li>
                <li>Later accusations have less power because they seem imitative</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Vote Fluidity Reading</h3>
            <p>Watch how people change their votes during discussion:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If someone changes votes easily, they're less confident in their theory</li>
                <li>If someone refuses to change votes despite pressure, they have conviction (good for Town, bad for Syndicate)</li>
                <li>Pressure voters who are flexible - they might switch to your side</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <strong>💡 Psychology Note:</strong> People who commit early to a position (like voting) are reluctant to change because changing means admitting they were wrong. Exploit this.

            <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <h3>Q: Should I always trust my ally?</h3>
            <p>A: Not always. Sometimes sacrificing an ally protects them long-term. If two Syndicates are under suspicion, eliminating one can establish the other's innocence.</p>

            <h3>Q: What if I'm caught lying?</h3>
            <p>A: Pivot immediately. Claim you misunderstood, reframe your lie as a theory, or admit the lie but claim you were testing someone. The key is not panicking.</p>

            <h3>Q: How do I recover if my cover is blown?</h3>
            <p>A: Sometimes you can't. Focus on protecting remaining Syndicates. If caught, act graceful and own the Syndicate victory when it happens.</p>

            <h3>Q: What if there's only one Syndicate left?</h3>
            <p>A: At this point, the Syndicate should reveal themselves strategically. If they're outnumbered and the Town is unified, the game is likely over. But if they can create doubt, they might survive.</p>

            <h3>Q: Is there a winning formula?</h3>
            <p>A: No formula guarantees victory. Every game is different because human psychology is unpredictable. Adaptability beats rigid strategies.</p>
