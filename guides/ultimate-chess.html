            <h2 id="overview">Game Overview</h2>
            <p>Ultimate Chess is the classic strategy game where two players command armies of pieces in a battle of wits. It's a game of perfect information (both players can see all pieces at all times) that rewards strategic thinking, tactical awareness, and the ability to calculate multiple moves ahead.</p>

            <p>Chess has been called "the game of kings" because it combines:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pure Logic:</strong> Every move can be analyzed objectively</li>
                <li><strong>Creative Problem-Solving:</strong> Multiple correct approaches to any position</li>
                <li><strong>Long-term Planning:</strong> Decisions made now impact your position 10+ moves later</li>
                <li><strong>Tactical Precision:</strong> A single missed move can decide the game</li>
                <li><strong>Psychological Warfare:</strong> Making your opponent uncomfortable with your play</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Basic Objectives</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Checkmate:</strong> Put opponent's King in a position where it's under attack and has no legal moves to escape</li>
                <li><strong>Check:</strong> Put opponent's King under direct attack (must be addressed immediately)</li>
                <li><strong>Material Advantage:</strong> Capture opponent's pieces while protecting your own</li>
                <li><strong>Position:</strong> Control important squares and create piece coordination</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="opening">Opening Principles</h2>

            <h3>The 7 Core Opening Rules</h3>

            <div class="principles-grid">
                <div class="principle">
                    <h4>1. Control the Center</h4>
                    <p>Play in the middle 4 squares (d4, d5, e4, e5). Most powerful pieces belong there early.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="principle">
                    <h4>2. Develop Your Pieces</h4>
                    <p>Get knights and bishops out before moving the same piece twice. Each piece should move toward active play.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="principle">
                    <h4>3. Castle Early</h4>
                    <p>Get your King to safety (usually within first 10 moves) by castling. An exposed King in the center is suicidal.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="principle">
                    <h4>4. Connect Your Rooks</h4>
                    <p>After castling and developing minor pieces, arrange so your Rooks support each other and control full files.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="principle">
                    <h4>5. Don't Bring Out Your Queen Too Early</h4>
                    <p>An exposed Queen is a target. Keep it protected and use it for threats, not for moving around.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="principle">
                    <h4>6. Protect Your King</h4>
                    <p>Don't leave your King on the first rank undefended. Consider pawn shields and ensure escape squares.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="principle">
                    <h4>7. Play with a Purpose</h4>
                    <p>Every move should accomplish something: control squares, develop pieces, create threats, or improve position.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="exercise-box">
                <strong>Practice Exercise:</strong> In your next 5 games, count how many moves pass before you castle. For strong players, it's typically 8-12 moves. If it's more, you're leaving your King exposed too long.
            </div>

            <h2 id="middle">Middle Game Strategy</h2>

            <h3>Key Middle Game Objectives</h3>

            <div class="concept-card">
                <h3>Create Threats Faster Than Opponent</h3>
                <p><strong>Concept:</strong> In the middle game, whoever creates more threats or more serious threats wins.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> You threaten opponent's Queen AND Bishop. Even if they can save both, they've used multiple moves defending while you've gotten ahead in development.</p>
                <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Look for "double attacks" or "forks" where one piece attacks two enemy pieces simultaneously.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-card">
                <h3>Maintain Piece Activity</h3>
                <p><strong>Concept:</strong> Active pieces (those attacking enemy pieces or controlling key squares) are worth more than passive pieces (those sitting on the back rank).</p>
                <p><strong>Activity Levels (Best to Worst):</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Currently attacking an enemy piece</li>
                    <li>Controlling important central squares</li>
                    <li>Supporting other pieces in attack</li>
                    <li>Defending your own pieces</li>
                    <li>Sitting passively waiting for something to do</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-card">
                <h3>Exploit Weak Squares</h3>
                <p><strong>Concept:</strong> Squares that opponents can't defend with pawns become permanent outposts for your pieces.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If opponent plays ...f6 (weakening the e6 square), you can plant a knight there permanently, and they can't remove it with a pawn.</p>
                <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Look for squares one knight jump away from opponent's King that they can't defend with pawns.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Middle Game Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Trading material when you have an attack:</strong> An attack is worth material. Don't trade it away.</li>
                <li><strong>Ignoring opponent's threats:</strong> While you attack their King, they might attack yours harder.</li>
                <li><strong>Moving the same piece multiple times:</strong> While you move your Queen around, opponent develops new pieces. You fall behind.</li>
                <li><strong>Neglecting piece safety:</strong> Constantly check: Is this piece attacked? Is it defended? Can it escape?</li>
                <li><strong>Playing without a plan:</strong> Follow a strategic idea (control a file, create an attack, improve weak square) rather than random moves.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Typically when most pieces are traded off, leaving mostly pawns, rooks, and the kings. Endgames require different strategic thinking than middle game.</p>

            <h3>Key Endgame Principles</h3>

            <div class="concept-card">
                <h3>The King Becomes Powerful</h3>
                <p>In the opening/middle game, the King hides. In the endgame, the King fights.</p>
                <p><strong>Why?</strong> With fewer pieces around, the King can't be mated as easily and can contribute to attacks and defense.</p>
                <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Activate your King. Centralize it. March it toward opponent's pawns or toward their King.</p>

            <div class="concept-card">
                <h3>Pawn Endgames Are Critical</h3>
                <p>Often the entire endgame boils down to the position of Kings and pawns. A single tempo (one move) can decide the game.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Concept: Opposition:</strong> If Kings face each other with one square between them, whoever moves loses the opposition and must give ground.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Concept: Pawn Promotion:</strong> Getting a pawn to the 8th rank usually wins the game instantly.</p>

            <div class="concept-card">
                <h3>Pawn Structure Matters More</h3>
                <p>In endgames, passed pawns (pawns with no enemy pawns blocking their advance) are incredibly valuable.</p>
                <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Create passed pawns and advance them. Stop opponent's passed pawns at all costs.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <strong>💡 Pro Tip:</strong> Many players know how to win when up material in endgames but don't know how to hold equal endgames. Study the Rook endgame extensively - it's the most common.

            <h2 id="tactics">Common Tactical Patterns</h2>

            <h3>1. Fork</h3>
            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> One piece attacks two enemy pieces simultaneously.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Knight on d4 attacks both the Rook on b5 and Queen on e6.</p>
            <p><strong>How to spot:</strong> Look for pieces that are spaced about a Knight's jump apart from the same color square.</p>

            <h3>2. Pin</h3>
            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> An enemy piece can't move because it would expose a more valuable piece behind it.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> A Bishop pins a Knight to the King. The Knight can't move without exposing the King to check.</p>
            <p><strong>How to use:</strong> Pins paralyze pieces. Even if the pinned piece could move, the player avoids it because the consequence is too severe.</p>

            <h3>3. Skewer</h3>
            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Like a pin, but the more valuable piece is in front and must move, exposing the less valuable piece behind.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> A Rook attacks the Queen, forcing it to move, then the Rook captures the Rook behind it.</p>

            <h3>4. Discovered Attack</h3>
            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Moving one piece uncovers an attack from another piece behind it.</p>
            <p><strong>Power:</strong> Often moving the front piece threatens while the back piece creates a second threat.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> You move your Knight, which uncovers your Bishop's attack on the Queen. The Knight also threatens the Rook. Opponent must deal with multiple threats.</p>

            <h3>5. Back Rank Mate</h3>
            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Opponent's King trapped on the back rank with no escape squares.</p>
            <p><strong>How to prevent:</strong> Create an escape square for your King (usually with f6 or h6 for Black, f3 or h3 for White) or keep a defending piece on the back rank.</p>

            <h3>6. Double Attack</h3>
            <p><strong>What it is:</strong> One move creates two separate threats that can't both be defended.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Your move checks the King AND threatens the Queen. They must respond to the check, losing the Queen.</p>
