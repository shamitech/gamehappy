            <h2>The Psychology Behind RPS</h2>
            <p>Rock Paper Scissors Psych isn't a game of chance if you understand human psychology. While basic RPS is 50/50, the psychological version is winnable through prediction and pattern recognition.</p>

            <h3>Core Principle: Humans Are Predictable</h3>
            <p>People don't throw randomly. They follow patterns based on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Recent results:</strong> After losing, many players switch their throw</li>
                <li><strong>Winning momentum:</strong> After winning, some players throw the same again or try the "counter" to what they expect</li>
                <li><strong>Tendency patterns:</strong> Some players favor certain throws</li>
                <li><strong>Fear of immediate repetition:</strong> Players rarely throw the same thing twice in a row</li>
                <li><strong>Psychological patterns:</strong> Beginners often follow predictable sequences</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Reading Your Opponent</h2>

            <h3>The Novice Pattern</h3>
            <p>New players follow this typical pattern: Rock → Paper → Scissors → Rock (cycling through). Many players never break this habit. If you notice cycling, predict ahead.</p>

            <h3>The Loss-Switch Pattern</h3>
            <p>Most players switch their throw immediately after losing. If they threw Rock and it lost to Paper, they'll throw Scissors next. Counter this by throwing Paper again.</p>

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>They Threw Last</th>
                    <th>You Showed</th>
                    <th>You Won With</th>
                    <th>They'll Likely Switch To</th>
                    <th>You Should Throw</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Rock</td>
                    <td>Paper</td>
                    <td>Paper</td>
                    <td>Scissors (to beat your Paper)</td>
                    <td>Rock (to beat their Scissors)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Paper</td>
                    <td>Scissors</td>
                    <td>Scissors</td>
                    <td>Rock (to beat your Scissors)</td>
                    <td>Paper (to beat their Rock)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Scissors</td>
                    <td>Rock</td>
                    <td>Rock</td>
                    <td>Paper (to beat your Rock)</td>
                    <td>Scissors (to beat their Paper)</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <div class="strategy-box">
                <strong>Strategy:</strong> In the first few rounds, don't worry about winning. Focus on learning your opponent's throwing patterns. Once you've identified a pattern, exploit it.
            </div>

            <h2>Advanced Prediction Techniques</h2>

            <h3>The Frequency Analysis</h3>
            <p>Over a series of games, track how often your opponent throws Rock, Paper, or Scissors. Most players have a preference:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Beginners often favor Rock (feels strong)</li>
                <li>Intermediate players favor Paper (covers Rock)</li>
                <li>Advanced players try to balance, but will have slight preferences</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If an opponent throws Rock 40% of the time, throw Paper 40% of the time to exploit this.</p>

            <h3>The Streak Strategy</h3>
            <p>Players who win on Rock tend to repeat it if they believe they can win again. Counter this by knowing their confidence pattern:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>After 1 win: They'll likely try the same again (60% chance)</li>
                <li>After 2 wins: They'll likely stick with it (70% chance)</li>
                <li>After 3+ wins: They might panic-switch (50/50 chance)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Mirror Pattern</h3>
            <p>Some players unconsciously mirror (throw what their opponent just threw). If this happens:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You throw Rock</li>
                <li>Opponent throws Rock (mirroring)</li>
                <li>You throw Paper next time (beating the mirror)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Counter-Strategies</h2>

            <h3>Against Predictable Players</h3>
            <p>If you've identified a pattern, exploit it relentlessly. Don't try to be random—be methodical. If they cycle Rock→Paper→Scissors, throw the counter to each in sequence.</p>

            <h3>Against Randomizers</h3>
            <p>Some players try to randomize after you identify their pattern. The solution: most people's "randomness" isn't random. Track the randomness and find the meta-pattern.</p>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <strong>💡 Pro Tip:</strong> Never get emotionally invested in a single throw. The moment you think "I'm throwing Rock no matter what," you've become predictable.
            </div>

            <h3>Against Psychological Warfare</h3>
            <p>Some players try mind games—hesitating, saying they'll throw something else, changing their hand position. Ignore this noise. Focus on their actual throws, not their intentions.</p>

            <h2>Building Your Own Unpredictability</h2>

            <h3>Controlled Randomness</h3>
            <p>To avoid being predictable, use a system of controlled randomness:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1st round: Throw based on the game state (start with Rock if nothing's known)</li>
                <li>2nd round: Follow your opponent's pattern</li>
                <li>3rd round: Throw what would counter them switching</li>
                <li>4th round: Occasionally throw wrong to reset their model of you</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Creating False Patterns</h3>
            <p>Deliberately show a pattern you don't actually follow, then break it at a critical moment:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Throw Rock three times (establishing a pattern)</li>
                <li>On round 4 when they expect Rock, throw Paper</li>
                <li>Their counter (Scissors) loses to your Paper</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Mental Game Management</h2>

            <h3>Stay Calm</h3>
            <p>Emotional players make predictable decisions. Stay composed even when losing.</p>

            <h3>Track Everything</h3>
            <p>Mental note-taking (or actual notes in longer series) helps you see patterns others miss.</p>

            <h3>Accept Variance</h3>
            <p>Even with perfect strategy, luck plays a minor role. What matters is winning more often than expected.</p>

            <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>People aren't truly random—they follow psychological patterns</li>
                <li>Track opponent behavior over multiple rounds to identify patterns</li>
                <li>Most common patterns: loss-switch, preference bias, cycling</li>
                <li>Winning in RPS Psych is about prediction, not luck</li>
                <li>Beat randomizers by finding the meta-patterns in their "randomness"</li>
                <li>Keep your own throw selection less predictable through controlled variation</li>
            </ul>
